## In August 2015, the Diablo 3 API became available...


---

## So I decided to ask the Diablo 3 Community what questions they'd like answered from the API.

---

# My question...

# The answers...

---

# I decided on two research questions..

---
<br>
## 1. Does the rank of a person correspond to any player statistic?

---

### What is a player statistic?

Again, the queston: 
<br>
<br>
Does the rank of a person correspond to any player statistic?
<hr>

To answer that, I created an interactive polychart.js graphic with "dat.gui" (angularJS) controls built in.


---

<section class="slide"><div>
<iframe src ='pics/graph1.html', width = "860px", height = "1000px"></iframe>
</div></section>

---

My second question was to answer what "clothing sets" are the most popular in the top leaderboard.

---

Clothing gives certain attributes to increase player stats.

---

To answer this, I looked at the most frequent sets per class. I wanted to look at the top 1000 and top 100 to see differences.

---

I'll use the "nv.d3" javascript library to plot each class and the most frequent sets used.

---
<section class="slide"><div>
Most frequent sets in the top 1000 of the Diablo 3 Season 6 leaderboard.


<iframe src ='pics/top1000.html', width = "860px", height = "1000px"></iframe>
