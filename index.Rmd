## What is Diablo 3?
<br>
<br>
* It is a competitive Action RPG

* You have unique skills and items that let you kill stuff faster
* How can you minimize and maximize your hero stats to win?

## In August 2015, the Diablo 3 API became available...


---

## So I decided to ask the Diablo 3 Community what questions they'd like answered from the API.

---

# My question...

# The answers...

# The answers...
![](pics/answer3.JPG)

---

# I decided on two research questions..

---
<br>
## 1. Does the rank of a person correspond to any player statistic?

---

### What is a player statistic?

![](pics/stat.jpg)

---


Again, the queston: 
<br>
<br>
Does the rank of a person correspond to any player statistic?
<hr>

To answer that, I created an interactive polychart.js graphic with "dat.gui" (angularJS) controls built in.


---

<section class="slide"><div>
<iframe src ='pics/graph1.html', width = "860px", height = "1000px"></iframe>
</div></section>

---

My second question was to answer what "clothing sets" are the most popular in the top leaderboard.

---

Clothing gives certain attributes to increase player stats.

![](pics/chest.jpg)

---

To answer this, I looked at the most frequent sets per class. I wanted to look at the top 1000 and top 100 to see differences.

---

I'll use the "nv.d3" javascript library to plot each class and the most frequent sets used.

---
<section class="slide"><div>
Most frequent sets in the top 1000 of the Diablo 3 Season 6 leaderboard.


<iframe src ='pics/top1000.html', width = "860px", height = "1000px"></iframe>
</div></section>

---
<section class="slide"><div>
Most frequent sets in the top 100 of the Diablo 3 Season 6 leaderboard.


<iframe src ='pics/top100.html', width = "860px", height = "1000px"></iframe>
</div></section>

---

### Methods

---


* Get the names of top 1000 players from the most current leaderboard from the Diablo 3 API.
<br>
* Get data of the top 1000 players from a different data source on the same API.
<br>
* Cleaning.
<br>
* Answer the research questions and create graphs.
* Host the data for people to see.



---

### First step <br>
 Get the names of top 1000 players from the most current leaderboard from the Diablo 3 API.


--- 


```{r, eval=F}
top1000<-fromJSON(paste0("https://us.api.battle.net/data/d3/season/6/leaderboard/achievement-points?access_token=",SARAKEY))
```

```{r, echo=F, eval=T}
load("data/top1000.RData")

results <- plyr::ldply(1:1000, function(i) {

  tempHero<-(top1000$row$player[[i]])$data[[1]] %>%
    filter(id %in% c("HeroBattleTag","HeroClass","HeroId"))  %>%
    select(string,number)

 (c(i,tempHero[1,1],tempHero[3,2],tempHero[2,1]))
})

colnames(results)<-c("Rank","HeroBattleTag","HeroId","HeroClass")

head(results)
```


---

```{r, echo=F}
head(results)
```

---

### Second step

<br>
Get data of the top 1000 players from a different data source on the same API.

---

I had to create unique urls for each user and their "hero" number...


```{r, eval=F}
heroItemURL <- lapply(1:1000, function(i) {
  
  paste0("https://us.api.battle.net/d3/profile/",
         results$HeroBattleTag[i],
         "/hero/",
         results$HeroId[i],
         "?locale=en_US&apikey=",
         key)
})

```

---

And then use that URL to create 1000 queries to the Battle.Net API

```{r, eval=F}

heroItems<-lapply(1:1000, function(i) {
  fromJSON(heroItemURL[[i]])
})

```


---

## I ran into a problem, however.

---

### There were unicode characters in some of the URLs (around 40-50 users)

"https://us.api.battle.net/d3/profile/流星追月#3113/hero/69485497?locale=en_US&apikey=SARAKEY"

---

Those URLs did not render in R, but they somehow fixed themselves and were able to correctly get back the data.

---

## Third step
<br>
Cleaning


---

### The data that was returned were in nested lists within lists...

---

### So I had to be creative in grabbing the data out of it. <br><br>

Here's an example:


```{r,eval=F}

setItems<- lapply(1:1000, function(i) {
  (heroItems[[i]]["items"][[1]][1][[1]]["setItemsEquipped"][[1]])
})

```


---

### More cleaning

Here's an example of a function I wrote called "setClean". <br>

This loops through the 6 classes to pull out the most frequent sets for each class.

```{r,eval=F}

setClean<-function(x){
as.data.frame(xtabs(~ setName + class , x))[!as.data.frame(xtabs(~ setName + class , x))$Freq==0, ]
}

classSets1000<-setClean(heroSetDataFinal) #all 1000 top players
classSets100<-setClean(filter(heroSetDataFinal, (rank%in%(1:100)))) #only the top 100 ranked players
                
head(classSets1000)       
```

---

## Fourth step
<br>
Creating graphs to answer my questions

---

I used the rCharts package to create the interactive visualizations

```{r, eval=F}
sets1000Plot <- nPlot(
  Freq ~ class, 
  group = "setName",
  data = classSets1000,
  type= "multiBarChart"
)
```


---


## Fifth step
<br>
Publishing my results


---

## To create these slides, I used *slidify*.

---

## I had a problem embedding the visualizations inside my slides. This took a while to figure out..

---

To solve this, I embedded the graphs with HTML iFrames.

---

## I also wanted to publish this on GitHub pages for other users to see.

* I used Jekyll
* GitHub Pages
* Slidify published on GitHub pages

---
## Jekyll

Jekyll is a static site generator that integrates with github. You can create and publish jekyll blogs to your github from RStudio using Yihui's Knitr Jekyll repo.

---

## Next steps

---

Plot my results onto a website for people to view on github.

Thanks!
